# Programming Cheatsheets

As part of my progrmaming journey, I have gone through a variety of tools and features, and everything that I am learning I am adding to these spreadsheets.

I hope that this will serve as something of a base of operations when it comes to learning new concepts - allowing me to go back to these notes for information without being forced to watch the same tutorials/read the same documentation.

Cheatsheets:

Key:
ðŸŸ© - High Quality
ðŸŸ¨ - Medium Quality
